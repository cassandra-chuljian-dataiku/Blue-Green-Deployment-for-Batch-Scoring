# HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT

This project is only an example of how things could be done. It can be modified to fit business deployment need if needed.
In the case of this project, here are the different states of a deployment lifecycle from a  **stable deployed champion model**  to a  **fully deployed challenger model** .

The satable  _DEPLOYED_  state is when the champion is fully deployed.
- MODEL_STATUS = DEPLOYED
- CHALLENGER_SPLIT = 0

## START OF DEPLOYMENT
The retraining of a challenger can be triggered
1. manually, 
2. after drift detection or
3. on a time based trigger through the [retrain_challenger](scenario:RETRAIN_CHALLENGER) scenario.


This transitions the deployement automatically to the  **first deployment stage**  (10/90 split)   _if the challenger passes the validation._ 
- MODEL_STATUS = IN DEPLOYMENT
- CHALLENGER_SPLIT = 10

The [periodic_check](scenario:PERIODIC_CHECK)  sceanrio is then trigger on a time based trigger and will switch the deployment to the  **next stage**  (50/50 split) *If the challenger passes the validation*
- MODEL_STATUS = IN DEPLOYMENT
- CHALLENGER_SPLIT = 50

_This process will loop for as many stages as encoded in the [update_challenger_deployment](scenario:UPDATE_CHALLENGER_DEPLOYMENT) scenario_

## END OF DEPLOYMENT

The [periodic_check](scenario:PERIODIC_CHECK) sceanrio is then trigger on a time based trigger and will switch the deployment to the next stage and **final stage** (100/0 split & fully replace the champion) with the challenger model. *If the challenger passes the validation*
- CHALLENGER_MODEL = Switched to the previous champion model.
- MODEL_STATUS = DEPLOYED
- CHALLENGER_SPLIT = 0
