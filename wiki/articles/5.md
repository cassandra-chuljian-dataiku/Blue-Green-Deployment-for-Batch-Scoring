# Scenario Deep-Dive
To run all of this project, we built **3 main scenarios** (and 3 other helper sceanrios)

## [_periodic_check](scenario:PERIODIC_CHECK)
On a periodic basis (Ex: Every week/ couple of days) This scenario will check:
- If the champion model is fully  _DEPLOYED_  then:
  - Run champion MES checks and **notify** on any warnings or errors.
- If the challenger model is  _IN DEPLOYMENT_  then:
  - Run evaluation checks on BOTH the champion and the challenger model and compare performances
  - If challenger performance is accepted then:
     - Go to the next stage of the deployement.
  
## [_retrain_challenger](scenario:RETRAIN_CHALLENGER)
On a periodic basis (Ex: every 2-3 months), on a manual trigger or a custom trigger, this scenario will retrain the model on new data.
- If the new Challenger model is accepted
  - Start the deployment process for the Challenger.
- Else
  - Rollback to the current Champion.

## [_run_pricing_model](scenario:RUN_PRICING_MODEL)
On a daily basis, this scenario will generate predictions on the daily data to score.
- It will use the Champion if the Champion is fully deployed.
- It will use a combination of the Champion and Challenger predictions if the model is in deployment (based on the spliting strategy)
