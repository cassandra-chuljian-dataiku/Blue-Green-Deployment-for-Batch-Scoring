# Blue Green Deployment

## Overview

The Goal of this project is to provide a template project showing how to **incrementally deploy** a new model to replace an existing one when **batch scoring in Dataiku**. i.e [Blue/Green Deployement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_deployment) of the model.
*Note: Blue/Green deployment is a concept used for software deployment but has transferable concepts to this task.*

The project acts as a starting point but can be modified to fit with *business rules* and *evaluation metrics* required by the business to smoothly transition or rollback models based on their **incremental performance checks** while deploying.

The project is divided in 4 sections : 
- [Training](flow_zone:default)
- [Split Strategy](flow_zone:zxmghd6)
- [Model Evaluation](flow_zone:XPCSR62)
- [Scoring](flow_zone:0PbNYNt)

There are 3 more sections added as helper Flow Zones for custom model evalution & feedback loops.
- [R2 Calculation on eval dataset](flow_zone:d33enLB)
- [R2 Calculations on daily scored data](flow_zone:sFfrQKx)
- [Calculated Field Performance Metrics](flow_zone:XHCHKLM)

The project is orchestrated my 3 main scenarios:
- [periodic_check](scenario:PERIODIC_CHECK)
- [retrain_challenger](scenario:RETRAIN_CHALLENGER)
- [run_pricing_model](scenario:RUN_PRICING_MODEL)

These scenarios will leverage 3 other help scenarios
- [BLUE_MES_AND_CHECKS](scenario:BLUE_MES_AND_CHECKS)
- [GREEN_MES_AND_CHECKS](scenario:GREEN_MES_AND_CHECKS)
- [update_challenger_deployment](scenario:UPDATE_CHALLENGER_DEPLOYMENT)
